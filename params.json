One exception to this rule is a directive that uses scope: { ... } -- this creates an \"isolate\" scope that does not prototypically inherit. This construct is often used when creating a \"reusable component\" directive.\r\n\r\nDeep dive into understanding directives.\r\n\r\n[Animation in AngularJS](http://www.yearofmoo.com/2013/04/animation-in-angularjs.html)\r\n\r\n> Up until now, it was safe to say that native animations were not present in AngularJS.

<p>This tutorial  explores the AngularJS framework by Google. It starts by briefly describing the design philosophy that the framework embodies and then quickly moves onto building a simple but nontrivial application to demonstrate the basics as well as some of AngularJS's most distinctive features including data binding, dependency injection, loosely coupled code, and conciseness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In AngularJS, a child scope normally prototypically inherits from its parent scope. One exception to this rule is a directive that uses scope: { ... } -- this creates an "isolate" scope that does not prototypically inherit. This construct is often used when creating a "reusable component" directive.</p>

<p>Special Pre-Minifier for AngularJS</p>

<p>This one tries to solve the problem compressing/uglifying code will break the dependency injection because of variable naming optimizations. Alternatively, you have to use a workaround defining an array with preceding injections. Sad to say, <code>ngmin</code> does not work with AMD (RequireJS) atm.</p>

<h2>Insights</h2>

<p>@<a href="http://github.com/knalli">knalli</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually, <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/angular">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/angular</a> is the very valuable source of information about AngularJS.</p>

<p>The official docs aren't always up to date, won't reflect both stable (1.0.x) and unstable (1.1.x) and don't contain so much examples (which you will notice after days/weeks).</p>

<p>So, indeed: Using Google the right way is important because Google indices both Groups and Stackoverflow very, very deep. And sometimes, you should look just at <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js">https://github.com/angular/angular.js</a> (including isssues and PRs)...</p>

<p>I'm working with AngularJS since October last year when we'd ported our app in a bigger rework process.</p>
